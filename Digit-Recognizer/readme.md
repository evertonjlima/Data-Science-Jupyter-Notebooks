# Digit Recognizer: MNIST Dataset

This repo is a collection of scripts and analysis related to [Kaggle's Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) challenge.

### Exploring the data.


The Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset consists of 42000 records of 785 features. Kaggle also makes available a test dataset of 28000 entries. The first feature is the label for the data. This feature describes which digit was written by a human. The additional 784 features represent a 28 by 28 image grid and the itensity value associated with it. This image is a pixel representation of the handwritten digit. Moreover, the intensity value ranges from 0 to 255 and it represents the lightness or darkness of that pixel. Below you can observe a few images generated from dataset. More information about the dataset can be found at the [Kaggle challenge page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), and the images were [generated by me](https://github.com/evertonjlima/Kaggle/blob/master/Digit-Recognizer/plotDigit.R).
