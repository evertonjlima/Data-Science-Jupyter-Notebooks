# Digit Recognizer: MNIST Dataset

This repo is a collection of scripts and analysis related to [Kaggle's Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) challenge.

## Exploring the data.

### Introduction

The Optical Recognition of Handwritten Digits dataset consists of 42000 records of 785 features. Kaggle also makes available a test dataset of 28000 entries. The first feature is the label for the data. This feature describes which digit was written by a human. The additional 784 features represent a 28 by 28 image grid and the itensity value associated with it. This image is a pixel representation of the handwritten digit. Moreover, the intensity value ranges from 0 to 255 and it represents the lightness or darkness of that pixel. Below you can observe a few images generated from dataset. More information about the dataset can be found at the [Kaggle challenge page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer), and the images were [generated by me](https://github.com/evertonjlima/Kaggle/blob/master/Digit-Recognizer/plotDigit.R).

### Useful features

From this images we can make some initial observations that may aid our classification algorithm. In the images above, pixels close to the border have no itensity associated with them. This indicates that there may be features that do not provide us with useful information for a classification task. This is indeed the case as it can see by applying R's summary function to the dataset, and several pixel entries have a mean of zero. 

```
  pixel0      pixel1      pixel2      pixel3      pixel4      pixel5      pixel6 
 Min.   :0   Min.   :0   Min.   :0   Min.   :0   Min.   :0   Min.   :0   Min.   :0  
 1st Qu.:0   1st Qu.:0   1st Qu.:0   1st Qu.:0   1st Qu.:0   1st Qu.:0   1st Qu.:0  
 Median :0   Median :0   Median :0   Median :0   Median :0   Median :0   Median :0  
 Mean   :0   Mean   :0   Mean   :0   Mean   :0   Mean   :0   Mean   :0   Mean   :0  
 3rd Qu.:0   3rd Qu.:0   3rd Qu.:0   3rd Qu.:0   3rd Qu.:0   3rd Qu.:0   3rd Qu.:0  
 Max.   :0   Max.   :0   Max.   :0   Max.   :0   Max.   :0   Max.   :0   Max.   :0 

```

Thus, a selection of useful features can be made. The selection results in 709 features what do not have all values set to zero, with 76 features being removed from the data.
